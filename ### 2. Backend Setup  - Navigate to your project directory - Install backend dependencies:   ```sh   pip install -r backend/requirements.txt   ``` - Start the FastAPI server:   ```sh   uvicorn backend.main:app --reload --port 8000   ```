## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to integrate the Inner → Outward component with your Entropy tokens:

### 1. Data Setup

Ensure you have the following data files in your project structure:

- `data/entropy_color_tokens.json` — Contains your colour token definitions
- `data/entropy_glyph_registry.normalized.json` — Contains your normalised glyph registry

### Backend Setup

- Navigate to your project directory
- Install backend dependencies: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
- Start the FastAPI server: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000`

### Frontend Integration

- Copy `EntropyInnerOutwardIntegrated.jsx` to your React project
- Import and mount the component in your application
- Configure your API proxy to forward `/tokens/*` and `/simulate/*` routes to the FastAPI backend

### Verifying the Setup

Test the installation by:

- Checking that colour tokens are correctly applied as CSS variables
- Confirming the pendulum animation renders properly
- Verifying that glyphs from your registry appear in the preview panel

## Troubleshooting

- If tokens don't appear, check that your JSON files are properly formatted and accessible.
- For pendulum simulation issues, verify the backend server is running.
- For styling problems, inspect the CSS variables in your browser's developer tools.
